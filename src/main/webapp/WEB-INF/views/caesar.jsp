        <h1>
        Gaius Julius Caesar
        </h1>
        <h2>
        (100 BC - 44 BC)
        </h2>
	        <p>
	       	Gauis Julius Caesar was born at the turn of the 1st century BC to a patrician family who traces its roots through the epic hero Aeneas back to the goddess Venus. It is a testimony to Caesar's excellence 
	       	that his progeny would sooner mention his name rather than the two former whilst bragging about their lineage -- and not only because he is nearer to them in years than the two former.
	       	Caesar would come into the Roman republic during a period of great social change catalyzed by the actions of the Gracchi brothers only 20 years before his mother Aurelia would give birth. 
	       	The Gracchi themselves seem to be antecedents to Caesar, Plutarch explaining how “these sons Cornelia reared with such scrupulous care that although confessedly no other Romans were so well endowed by nature, 
	       	they were thought to owe their virtues more to education than to nature” and it seems Caesar was both afforded an almost divine predestination to do great things and a loving mother in Aurelia. 
	       	Caesar's uncle was the great Gauis Marius, a new man that would find a chief opponent in his junior commander Sulla. The young Caesar was also given a bride, Cornelia, daughter of his uncle's greatest ally, Cinna. 
	       	After the battle at the Colline Gate, Sulla would successfully defeat the Marians and become dictator of the Republic after years of civil war. Naturally, watchful eyes were preying on Caesar at a young age due to his familial connections.   		
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Sulla demanded Caesar divorce his wife, as he had with many other of the magistrates in Rome. The difference between Caesar and these other men was that he was the only one to deny Sulla's request. 
	        Divorce was not exactly uncommon in the Roman republic, and with the threat of Sulla's proscriptions still looming over many of Cinna and Marius’ sympathizers, 
	        Caesar’s decision to deny the dictator's request would be among the first signs that within Caesar burned obdurate ambition and unfaltering confidence beyond that of any of his contemporaries. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Regardless of his intentions, Caesar's risk would have likely ended in his death if not for his mother pleading with the vestal virgins to speak on her sons behalf. Again his death would have been certain
	        if it were not for the sum equivalent to a hundred years pay that Caesar paid as a bribe to one of Sulla's men who happened upon him deep in the Italian countryside.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        It would not seem that Caesar's physical appearance was anything too remarkable in his youth as to give him the remarkable confidence he showed in defying Sulla. Caesar was pale, slightly built, 
	        with piercing dark eyes. He took great care in grooming himself and separated himself amongst the forum by wearing his toga with a large belt on the outside. 
	        Caesar did not seem to be striving for revolution throughout his career, in contrast to the writings of many ancient authors. Cicero, observing Caesar in a disputation on the senate floor thinks to himself: 
	        “And yet, when I look at his hair, arranged so perfectly, I cannot believe that this fellow would ever dream of so appalling a crime as the destruction of the Roman state.”
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Caesar was again safely recieved into Rome with his wife Cornelia thanks to his mother. He was now 19, and not intending to further upset the dictator Sulla, Caesar would begin his mandatory years of military service in Asia and 
	        would not return to Rome until the dictator's death. Under the command of his propraetor, Caesar would be sent to the court of King Nicomedes of Bithynia. An abhorrent rumour began to make its rounds among the men that Caesar 
	        had been seduced and lay with King, due to his uncharacteristically lackadaisical conduct in his duties, preferring to revel in the luxuries of the foreign court instead of carrying out his bureaucratic responsibilities.        
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Almost certainly the rumor was fabricated to harm Caesar's reputation which at this point was widely respected due to his previous appointment to the office of Flamen Dialis, 
	        the highest position in the flaminate, which he stood for before Sulla's arrival to Rome. Plutarch tells us Sulla personally denied the young Caesar this title but other authors contend that Caesar denied this 
	        title before setting out for Asia due to its many restrictions that would prevent him from joining the higher ranks of the magistracy. For instance, the flamen were prohibited from seeing a cadaver, 
	        and even weirder, they were prohibited from seeing an empty table for they were never supposed to be seen in want. The rumor regarding Nicomedes can also be widely proven as a falsity in hindsight, 
	        since Caesar was perhaps the most notorious womanizer in Rome upon his return, having a taste exclusively for the wives of his fellow Senators.  
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Following the controversy with Nicomedes, Caesar transferred to Cilicia in modern day Southern Turkey to help remedy the piracy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Not long after his embarkation from Bithynia to Cilicia, 
	        news of Sulla's death reached Caesar, compelling him to return to Rome and further his name by advocating in the courts. Over the next few years, Caesar would play the role of prosecutor in Rome’s courts, 
	        prosecuting on cases of gubernatorial extortion and greed. The maltreatment of the provinvials by their Roman governors was so rampant and met with such indifference by the Roman magistracy that even the “noblest Roman of them all”, 
	        Brutus, likely practiced usury against his provincials decades later. One such governor was Dolabella, who was accused of extortion in his province of Macedonia, 
	        and would be Caesar's first major case on the behalf of his Macedonian clients. The defense for Dolabella would consist of two leading orators at the time, Quintus Hortensius and Gauis Aurelius Cotta, 
	        both of which Cicero himself would strive to emulate. The odds against Caesar were formidable and Dolabella would be acquitted, but not before Caesar impressed many with his oratory. 
	        Caesar would have one more notable appearance as a prosecutor, this time against Caius Antonius. Again Caesar surpassed expectations in his speech, nevertheless, 
	        Antonius appealed to a tribune of the plebs and the proceedings were vetoed before a verdict could be met. 	        
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        It seems Caesar may have made some enemies as a result of his fervent speeches against the former consul Dolabella, prompting him to depart for Rhodes to study under Apollonius who had studied with Cicero only years earlier. 
	        Appollionus is remembered in history only for the instruction of his formerly mentioned students and if you will forgive my digression that will hopefully give a fuller context of the times, as a critic of Judaism, 
	        “calumniating Moses as an impostor, and a deceiver; and pretending that Judaic laws teach wickedness; but nothing that is virtuous.” Caesar himself lived near a Jewish slum in Rome for some time, but other than that 
	        it does not seem as if the Old Religion had much of an impact on Caesar himself or any of his contemporaries. In only sixty years time, during the reign of Augustus, would Our Saviour Christ be born to the Blessed Virgin.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Incidentally, Caesar would have to wait before he could continue his studies, for he was captured by pirates, the very same he was sent to Cilicia to contain years before. 
	        The pirates demanded a ransom of 20 talents of silver for his release. Upon hearing which Caesar burst into laughter at the miscalculation of his worth, insisting to the pirates that he would pay 50 talents. 
	        After allowing some of his companions to depart to collect the ransom, Caesar would be rash aboard his captors ship, and according to Plutarch “he was so contemptuous of them that whenever he had a mind to sleep 
	        he would send and order them to be quiet. He was present thirty eight days with them, taking parts in their sports and their exercises as if they were not his jailers but his bodyguard. He wrote poems, too, and 
	        speeches which he read to them, and those who did not admire them he would call them straight out ignorant barbarians, and would often threaten laughingly to hang them all. The pirates enjoyed it and ascribed his 
	        bold talk to simplicity and boyish playfulness.” Caesar would immediately prove to the pirates that this was in fact not the case, for upon the payment of the 50 talents and his release, Caesar built up a small fleet and imprisoned most of his 
	        captors. Not being a magistrate, Caesar appealed to the governor of Asia to execute the prisoners, and upon being denied, Caesar made his way back to the pirates and crucified all of them on his own initiative.
