        <h1>
        Gaius Julius Caesar
        </h1>
        <h2>
        (100 BC - 44 BC)
        </h2>
	        <p>
	       	Gauis Julius Caesar was born at the turn of the 1st century BC to a patrician family who traces its roots through the epic hero Aeneas back to the goddess Venus. It is a testimony to Caesar's excellence that his progeny would sooner mention his name rather than the two former whilst bragging about their lineage -- and not only because he is nearer to them in years than the two former.
	       	Caesar would come into the Roman republic during a period of great social change catalyzed by the actions of the Gracchi brothers only 20 years before his mother Aurelia would give birth. 
	       	The Gracchi themselves seem to be antecedents to Caesar, Plutarch explaining how “these sons Cornelia reared with such scrupulous care that although confessedly no other Romans were so well endowed by nature, 
	       	they were thought to owe their virtues more to education than to nature” and it seems Caesar was both afforded an almost divine predestination to do great things and a loving mother in Aurelia. 
	       	Caesar's uncle was the great Gauis Marius, a new man that would find a chief opponent in his junior commander Sulla. The young Caesar was also given a bride, Cornelia, daughter of his uncle's greatest ally, Cinna. 
	       	After the battle at the Colline Gate, Sulla would successfully defeat the Marians and become dictator of the Republic after years of civil war. Naturally, watchful eyes were preying on Caesar at a young age due to his familial connections.   		
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Sulla demanded Caesar divorce his wife, as he had with many other of the magistrates in Rome. The difference between Caesar and these other men was that he was the only one to deny Sulla's request. 
	        Divorce was not exactly uncommon in the Roman republic, and with the threat of Sulla's proscriptions still looming over many of Cinna and Marius’ sympathizers, 
	        Caesar’s decision to deny the dictator's request would be among the first signs that within Caesar burned obdurate ambition and unfaltering confidence beyond that of any of his contemporaries.  
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        It would not seem that Caesar's physical appearance was anything too remarkable in his youth as to give him the remarkable confidence he showed in defying Sulla. Caesar was pale, slightly built, with piercing dark eyes. He took great care in grooming himself and separated himself amongst the forum by wearing his toga with a large belt on the outside. Caesar did not seem to be striving for revolution throughout his career, in contrast to the writings of many ancient authors. Cicero, observing Caesar in a disputation on the senate floor thinks to himself: “And yet, when I look at his hair, arranged so perfectly, I cannot believe that this fellow would ever dream of so appalling a crime as the destruction of the Roman state.”
